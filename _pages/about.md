I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering at the Institute of Pioneer Semiconductor Innovation (Chip Design Group), National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, working in the Parallel Computing System Laboratory under Professor Lai, Bo-Cheng.

My research focuses on developing advanced methodologies for intelligent computing, with an emphasis on hardware-software co-acceleration and heterogeneous platforms integrating FPGAs and GPUs.

I am also a Digital Design Intern at Andes Technology Corporation, focusing on CPU-related AI accelerator development, and an Affiliate Trainee at the A3D3 Institute (University of Washington), where I work on optimizing GPU algorithms for particle physics experiments.
