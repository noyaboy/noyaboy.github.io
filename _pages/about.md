I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering at the Institute of Pioneer Semiconductor Innovation (ICS &amp; EDA Group), National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, working in the Parallel Computing System Laboratory under Professor Lai, Bo-Cheng.

## Research Interests

I specialize in the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Computer Architecture, targeting the rigorous optimization of CUDA pipelines. My work involves using NVIDIA NSYS and NCU to conduct deep-dive profiling, systematically addressing architectural constraints to minimize data transfer latency and optimize compute resource utilization.
