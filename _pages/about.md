I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Digital VLSI and System Design at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, working in the Parallel Computing System Laboratory under Professor Lai, Bo-Cheng. My research focuses on developing advanced methodologies for intelligent computing, with an emphasis on hardware-software co-acceleration and heterogeneous platform integrating FPGA and GPU.
