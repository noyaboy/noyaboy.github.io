excerpt: 'Abstract: We propose a high-performance hardware implementation for GNN-based trajectory reconstruction, tailored for the computing demands of the High-Luminosity LHC. This work focuses on optimizing the hardware mapping of Graph Neural Networks onto FPGA platforms to maximize throughput and minimize latency. The proposed architecture, referred to as HiGTR, employs efficient dataflow management and processing element utilization to handle the sparse and irregular nature of graph data in particle tracking. Experimental results indicate that our FPGA-based solution significantly exceeds the baseline latency and throughput requirements, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time edge processing in high-energy physics applications.'

Abstract: We propose a high-performance hardware implementation for GNN-based trajectory reconstruction, tailored for the computing demands of the High-Luminosity LHC. This work focuses on optimizing the hardware mapping of Graph Neural Networks onto FPGA platforms to maximize throughput and minimize latency. The proposed architecture, referred to as HiGTR, employs efficient dataflow management and processing element utilization to handle the sparse and irregular nature of graph data in particle tracking. Experimental results indicate that our FPGA-based solution significantly exceeds the baseline latency and throughput requirements, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time edge processing in high-energy physics applications.
