permalink: /publication/2025-fastml-gpu-tracking
excerpt: 'Abstract: Standard Kalman Filter-based tracking algorithms are computationally intensive and struggle to scale with the high-luminosity conditions expected at future colliders. This work presents a real-time GPU-accelerated tracking approach that leverages kernel refactoring and low-precision INT8 surrogates to enhance performance. By optimizing memory access patterns and utilizing reduced-precision arithmetic, we achieve a substantial speedup in tracking throughput without compromising physics accuracy. The proposed method effectively utilizes the massive parallelism of modern GPUs, demonstrating its potential as a viable solution for the online trigger level tracking at the HL-LHC.'

Abstract: Standard Kalman Filter-based tracking algorithms are computationally intensive and struggle to scale with the high-luminosity conditions expected at future colliders. This work presents a real-time GPU-accelerated tracking approach that leverages kernel refactoring and low-precision INT8 surrogates to enhance performance. By optimizing memory access patterns and utilizing reduced-precision arithmetic, we achieve a substantial speedup in tracking throughput without compromising physics accuracy. The proposed method effectively utilizes the massive parallelism of modern GPUs, demonstrating its potential as a viable solution for the online trigger level tracking at the HL-LHC.
