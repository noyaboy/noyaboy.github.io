excerpt: 'Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar sub-categories within a broader class. While most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures. In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by introducing a novel training framework called Teacher-Guided Data Augmentation (TGDA). TGDA integrates data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework enables the training of high-performance FGIR systems entirely from scratch, unlocking the design of task-specific architectures such as LRNets for low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for efficient inference. Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks show that our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts, improving accuracy by up to 23% in low-resolution settings while significantly reducing parameters and computational costs.'

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar sub-categories within a broader class. While most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures. In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by introducing a novel training framework called Teacher-Guided Data Augmentation (TGDA). TGDA integrates data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework enables the training of high-performance FGIR systems entirely from scratch, unlocking the design of task-specific architectures such as LRNets for low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for efficient inference. Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks show that our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts, improving accuracy by up to 23% in low-resolution settings while significantly reducing parameters and computational costs.
