Role: Senior Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer



Task: Update the "Portfolio"  section of my website.



Context:

I have a personal portfolio website (currently hosted at https://noyaboy.github.io/portfolio/). I need to refresh the project showcase section to reflect my latest work.



Instructions:



1. **Remove Existing Content**:

   - Completely remove the existing project entry titled "traccc Optimization" in Portfolio.



2. **Add New Projects**:

   - Insert the following 4 projects into the portfolio.

   - Use the titles, descriptions, and tech stacks provided below.

   - Ensure the design style (cards, layout, fonts, buttons) matches the existing aesthetic of the website.

   - If the current site uses tags or icons for languages (like C++, Python), please apply them accordingly.
